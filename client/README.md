## Frontend Directory
This is a frontend created with [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/), a framework for React.js. It was made with the help of the [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app) command.

### Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the login page.

[API routes](https://nextjs.org/docs/api-routes/introduction) have yet to be implemented, as such the login page does not connect to the backend just yet.

### Learn Next.js

To learn more about Next.js, take a look at the following resources:

- [Next.js Documentation](https://nextjs.org/docs) - learn about Next.js features and API.
- [Learn Next.js](https://nextjs.org/learn) - an interactive Next.js tutorial.

You can check out [the Next.js GitHub repository](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/) - your feedback and contributions are welcome!

## Deployment
